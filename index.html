My name is leewilliam236, and welcome to my website! 
<br>
<p>I'm a student currently at De Anza College planning to transfer as a 
  Software Engineering major at a Cal State! (My target is SJSU)</p>
<br>
<p>I only know how to code in C++, but am willing to pick up other languages if I have the time!</p>
