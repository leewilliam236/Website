<h1>Hello World!</h1>

My name is leewilliam236, and welcome to my website! I'm a student currently at De Anza College planning to transfer as a 
Software Engineering major at a Cal State! (My target is SJSU)

I only know how to code in C++, but am willing to pick up other languages if I have the time!
